What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

When I initialize with git init, many directories are create in folder .git
I need to do it in order to get branch git directory

when run git status, I get :

Initial commit

Untracked files:
  (use "git add <file>..." to include in what will be committed)
