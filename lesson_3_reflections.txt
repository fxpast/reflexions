When would you want to create a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
When I have to share my text and when another writer will update it.


Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
I thought about that, even we use git command it is better to use automatic remote commands.


Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
forks : is used to copy repository on GItHub
clone : is used to copy repository from GitHub to local
branch : is used to commit , to log, and to remote file.
